====

This project is a simple 3D terrain generator that works with OpenGL. This project is inspired by "Coding Challenge #11: 3D Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise in Processing" from The Coding Train.

Compiling
---------

Use build.sh to build the broject for Visual Studio 2017

> You should always be able to delete the `build` (and it will be deleted when you run build.sh) directory without losing your work. Whatever you do, work in the `program` directory.

Edit CMakeLists.txt to decide which files and libraries to compile.
